To play this you have to just download main file, place any image in the same folder,
and change and change _**imagename**_ variable.

Move the tiles using arrow keys.

Also you can easily change variables at the top of the code:

- **_imagename_** - change the name of an image to play with.


- **_Board_Width_**, **_Board_Height_** - which will change how many tiles there are.
  originally the game of fifteen has a 4x4 board.


- **_tile_size_** - which changes how big is every tile.


- And a few other variables that don't matter much.
