# HoloVirus

### Not really a virus, will not kill a computer.

This program just downloads and opens a lot of images.

in code you can easily change a few variables:

- **_delay_** - Milliseconds delay between images.
- **_images_folder_** - Where to save downloaded images.
- **_max_images_** - How many images the program can open simultaneously.
- **_fun_level_** - How hard is it to close a program.

#### There are already 2 .exe files in a repository:

- **safe_version** is safe, it will only download images, and lag for a minute or so,
  then it will reach a low maximum opened images.

  It is also easy to close.


- **good_luck_version** is not safe, it will open images indefinitely,
  the only harm it can do is that you will need to restart your pc—é
