# HoloVirus

### Not really a virus, will not kill a computer.

This program just downloads and spams a lot of images.

in code you can easily change images that download, maximum images to open,
how hard will it be do close the program, and more.

There are already 2 .exe files in a repository:

- **safe_verison** is safe, it will only download images, and lag for a minute or so,
  then it will reach a low maximum opened images.

  It is also easy to close.


- **good_luck_version** is not safe, it will open images indefinitely,
  the only harm it can do is that you will need to restart your pc—é
